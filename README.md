## Emphasis on Kitab al-Ibadat (The Book of Worship)

The reason there are more chapters in the "Book of Worship" (Kitab al-Ibadat) compared to the other sections is likely due to the extensive range of acts of worship and rituals in Islam.

Worship is a central aspect of Islamic practice, encompassing various rituals, prayers, and acts of devotion that Muslims engage in to strengthen their faith and connection with Allah. Therefore, Imam al-Ghazali dedicates more chapters to this section to comprehensively cover the different aspects of worship in Islam, providing guidance on the proper manners, etiquettes, and spiritual dimensions of each act of worship.

Additionally, worship in Islam is not confined to specific times or rituals but extends to various dimensions of daily life, including prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.

Each of these acts of worship has its own significance, rules, and spiritual benefits, which al-Ghazali aims to elucidate in his work. Hence, the "Book of Worship" encompasses a broader range of topics compared to other sections, necessitating a greater number of chapters to cover them adequately.
